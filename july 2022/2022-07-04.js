// Reverse list order

// In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order

// Examples (Input -> Output)
// [1, 2, 3, 4]  -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
// [9, 2, 0, 7]  -> [7, 0, 2, 9]



// P: Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given strings/ Will we be given special characters? Will we be given floats? will we be given integers? Will we be given negative numbers? Will we be given positive numbers?



// R: Return a new array where the given array has been reversed in order.
