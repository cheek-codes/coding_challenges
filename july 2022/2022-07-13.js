// Multiplication table for number

// Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer form 1 to 10.

// For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:
// 1 * 5 = 5
// 2 * 5 = 10
// 3 * 5 = 15
// 4 * 5 = 20
// 5 * 5 = 25
// 6 * 5 = 30
// 7 * 5 = 35
// 8 * 5 = 40
// 9 * 5 = 45
// 10 * 5 = 50

// PS You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

// Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the formate, look at the sample tests.



// P: Will we be given strings? Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given special characters? Will we be given floats? Will we be given negative numbers? Will we be given positive numbers?
