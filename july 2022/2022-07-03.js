// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)

// P: Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given strings/ Will we be given special characters? Will we be given floats? Will we be given integers? Will we be given negative numbers? Will we be given positive numbers?



// R: Return an integer where the father was twice as old as the son or will be twice as old as the son



// E: 1. If we are given 36 for the father and 7 for the son, should return 22
// E: 2. If we are given 55 for the father and 30 for the son, should return 5
// E: 3. If we are given 42 for the father, and 21 for the son, should return 0
// E: 4. If we are given 22 for the father, and 1 for the son, should return 20
// E: 5. If we are given 29 for the father, and 0 for the son, should return 29
