// Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions

// Information:
// Messi goal scoring statistics:
// Competition --> Goals
// La Liga --> 43
// Champions League --> 10
// Copa del Rey --> 5

// Task:
// 1. Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
// laLigaGoals
// championsLeagueGoals
// copaDelReyGoals

// 2. Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.



// P: Will we be given strings? Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given floats? Will we be given negative numbers? Will we be given only integers?



// R: Make a new variable called laLigaGoals and assign it 43
// R: Make a new variable called championsLeagueGoals and assign it 10
// R: Make a new variable called copaDelReyGoals and assign it 5
// R: Make a new variable called totalGoals and concatinate it with the laLigaGoals, championsLeagueGoals, and copaDelReyGoals
