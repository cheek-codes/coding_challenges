// Return Strings

// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]



// P: Will we be given numbers such as floats and integers? Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given uppercase letters? Will we be given lowercase letters?
