// Return Strings

// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]



// P: Will we be given numbers such as floats and integers? Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given uppercase letters? Will we be given lowercase letters?



// R: Return a new string of "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?" where <name> is the given parameter. 



// E: 1. If we are given a parameter name of "Sandy", should return "Hello, Sandy how are you doing today?"
// E: 2. If we are given a parameter name of "Chris", should return "Hello, Chris how are you doing today?"
// E: 3. If we are given a parameter name of "pumpkin", should return "Hello, pumpkin how are you doing today?"



function greet(name) {
    // return string using +
    return "Hello, " + name + " how are you doing today?";
}
