# Convert a number to a string

#We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

# What ways of achieving this do you know?

# Examples (input --> output):
# 123  --> "123"
# 999  --> "999"
# -100 --> "-100"




# P: Will we be given strings? Will we be given an empty string? Will we be given special characters? Will we be given a floats? Will we be given an integer? Will we be given negative numbers? Will we be given positive numbers
