# Return negative

# In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

# Examples:
# makeNegative(1);    --> return -1
# makeNegative(-5);   --> return -5
# makeNegative(0);    --> return 0
# makeNegative(0.12); --> return -0.12

# Notes:
# The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
# Zero(0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.




# P: Will we be given strings? Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given floats? Will we be given positive integers? Will we be given negative integers?



# R: Return a negative number if the given integer is a positive number.
# R: Return a negative number if the given integer is a negative number. So no change is needed to this given number
# R: Return zero(0) if the given integer is a zero(0)
