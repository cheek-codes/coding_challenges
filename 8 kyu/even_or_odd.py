# Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers of "Odd" for odd numbers.

# Will we be given an empty string? Will we be given a string? Will we be given any special characters? Will we be given a float? Will we be given an integer? Will we be given a negative number? Will we be given a positive number?

# R: Return "Even" if the given integer is an even number (if the given number is divisible by 2 and has no remainders)
# R: Return "Odd" if the given integer is an odd number (if the given number is not divisible by 2 and has remainders)
