// Initialize my name


// Some people just have a first name; some people have first and last names, and some people have first, middle, and last names.

// Your task is to initialize the middel names (if there are any)

// Examples
// 'Jack Ryan'                   => 'Jack Ryan'
// 'Lois Mary Lane'              => 'Lois M. Lane'
// 'Dimitri'                     => 'Dimitri'
// 'Alice Betty Catherine Davis' => 'Alice B. C. Davis'





// Will we be given strings? Will we be given empty strings? Will we be given special characters? Will we be given floats? Will we be given integers?




// Return a new string where the middle name(s) are initialized





// If we were given 'Jack Ryan', should return 'Jack Ryan'
// If we were given 'Lois Mary Lane', should return 'Lois M. Lane'
// If we were given 'Dimitri', should return 'Dimitri'
// If we were given 'Alice Betty Catherine Davis', should return 'Alice B. C. Davis'
