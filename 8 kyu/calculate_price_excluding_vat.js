// Calculate Price Excluding VAT

// Write a function that calculates the original product price, without VAT.

// Example
// If a product price is 200.00 and VAT is 15%, then the final product price (with VAT) is: 200.00 + 15% = 230.00

// Thus, if your function receives 230.00 as input, it should return 200.00

// Notes:

// VAT is always 15% for the purposes of this Kata.
// Round the result to 2 decimal places.
// If null value given then return -1




// Will we be given a string? Will we be given special characters? Will we be given floats? Will we be given integers? Will we be given negative numbers? Will we be given positive numbers?




// Return -1 if excludingVatPrice(price) is null
// Return a number rounded to the nearest two decimal places after mathing price/1.15




// If we were given excludingVatPrice(230), should return 200.00
// If we were given excludingVatPrice(123), should return  106.96
// If we were given excludingVatPrice(null), should return -1
