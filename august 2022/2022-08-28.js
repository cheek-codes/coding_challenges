// Simple multiplication

// This kata is about multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.



// P: Will we be given an empty string? Will we be given a string? Will we be given floats? Will we be given a negative integer? Will we be given a positive integer?



// R: Return a new number that was multiplied by 8 if that given number was even
// R: Return a new number that was multiplied by 9 if that given number was odd.



// E: 1. If we are given 2, should return 16 because 2 * 8 = 16
// E: 2. If we are given 1, should return 9 because 1 * 9 = 9
